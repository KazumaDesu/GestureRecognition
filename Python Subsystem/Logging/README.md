# Logger
This folder contains the Python implementation of a generic logger

## Getting Started
import the class, instantiate, and log whatever you want. The log files will follow a format like:
```
USERCHOSENFILENAME_HOUR_MINUTE_SECOND.txt
```
All you need to do is supply the name, the time will be automatically appended.

## Deployment
Import the class anywhere you want to log. The filename is a class instance variable, so it should be instance-safe
